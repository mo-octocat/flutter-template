# IssueOps for creating GitHub repositories

## Motivation

Many enterprises struggle around [repository creation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository), balancing best practices with developer experience:

- How visible should this be?
- Is access being only being granted to teams?
- Are branch protection rules in place?
- Is it clear who owns the repository?
- Can we satisfy regulatory requirements around controls?

For enterprises that cannot allow developers to create repositories directly, the following solution walks through a possible solution built around native GitHub functionality to provide a transparent, auditable, and minimal process to facilitate repository creation needs.

## Overview

Like many internal GitHub processes, this solution is built leveraging [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) and [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions) to facilitate requests for repository creation.

Upon filling out the issue form, a team of people can review and approve requests without having to be organization owners.

For faster response time, leverage [Slack](https://slack.github.com/) or [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.github.com/) integrations to notify responsible party when issues are created.

## Benefits

1. Self-documenting process
1. Auditable as issues and comments are preserved in 1 place
1. Capable of notifying relevant parties in a timely manner
1. Leverages GitHub App for necessary elevated permissions
1. Assign people to review and approve from a designated team, no organization owner access needed

## Prerequisites

1. [GitHub issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) access
1. Ability to setup one of supported mechanisms for escalated privileges:
   1. Enterprise Personal Access Token (PAT)  _(require enterprise owner access)_
   1. GitHub App  _(requires organization owner access)_

## Setup

### Step 1: Authentication setup

**Choose one of the following based on your situation, both are equally valuable and supported**

#### Option 1: GitHub App for organization-wide usage

The GitHub App route of gaining elevated access to an organization is that it is not tied to a user and does not cost a user license.  The downside is that GitHub Apps are organization specific, so this approach can only managed the 1 organization.

1. [Create new GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app) with the following:

   - **Homepage URL**:  URL of repository containing workflow and issue forms
   - **Webhooks**:  disable
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - administration (read and write)
     - issues (read and write)
   - **Organization permissions**:
     - members (read-only)

1. Generate [private key](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps)

   _Note: we will need this and the App ID shortly in setting up GitHub Action secrets_

1. [Install newly created GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/installing-github-apps) into the organization

1. Create the following [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   1. `APP_ID`:  using the App ID from the General > About section of the GitHub App
   1. `APP_PEM`:  using the downloaded private key from the General > Private keys section of the GitHub App


#### Option 2: Enterprise Personal Access Token (PAT) for enterprise-wide usage

The Enterprise PAT route of gaining elevated access to an organization is that it can manage multiple organization across an enterprise.  The downside is that it is tied to a user account, which should be a machine user to avoid disturbances when people are offboarded.

1. Generate [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) under the machine user account with the following permissions:

   - **repo**
   - **read:org**

1. Create the following [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

   1. `ISSUEOPS_TOKEN`:  using personal access token of the machine user account

### Step 2: Organization teams for review and approval

1. Create and populate organization teams with individuals for various roles:

   - **`lgtm`**: individuals who can approve requests
   - **`lgtm-reviewers`**: nested team of `lgtm` of individuals who will be assigned to review and approve requests

   ![Screenshot illustrating nested team relationship described above](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2089743/169402822-cff62b00-316d-4841-ad8b-dfb04133d55f.png)

### Step 3: GitHub Action workflow setup

1. Create repository containing the following issue labels:

   - `administration`
   - `createrepo`

1. Create `.github` directory containing [issue forms and workflows from `assets` directory](assets)

   ```
   └── .github
       ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE
       │   └── createrepo.yml
       └── workflows
           ├── createrepo_assign.yml
           ├── createrepo_fulfill.yml
           └── createrepo_validate.yml
   ```

1. Update the list of organizations in **repository-owner** field within `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/createrepo.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - type: dropdown
      id: repository-owner
      attributes:
         label: Repository owner
         description: Select an owner
         options:
         - tinyfists
         - visibilitysaurus
   ```

   > **Note**
   > For multiple organizations, an Enterprise PAT is required.  Otherwise, limit this to the organization where GitHub App is installed.

1. Update the inputs for `issueops-createrepo` action(s) within the workflows based on your authentication setup:

   - Option 1: GitHub App for organization-wide usage

     ```yaml
           - name: Assign
             uses: ./actions/assign
             with:
               authentication: app
               application-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
               application-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PEM }}
               team-assign: ${{ env.LGTM_TEAM }}
     ```

   - Option 2: Enterprise Personal Access Token (PAT) for enterprise-wide usage

     ```yaml
           - name: Assign
             uses: ./actions/assign
             with:
               authentication: token
               github-token: ${{ secrets.ISSUEOPS_TOKEN }}
               team-assign: ${{ env.LGTM_TEAM }}
     ```

## Alterations and Workarounds

### Customizing approver and reviewer team names

You can choose different names by modifying the `LGTM_TEAM` value in respective workflows:

- `.github/workflows/createrepo_assign.yml`:

  ```yaml
  name: Create Repo - Assign
  on:
     issues:
        types:
        - opened
  env:
     LGTM_TEAM: lgtm-reviewers
  ```

- `.github/workflows/createrepo_fulfill.yml`:

  ```yaml
  name: Create Repo - Fulfill
  on:
     issue_comment:
        types:
        - created
  env:
     LGTM_TEAM: lgtm
  ```

- `.github/workflows/createrepo_validate.yml`:

  ```yaml
  name: Create Repo - Validate
  on:
     issues:
        types:
        - opened
        - edited
  env:
     LGTM_TEAM: lgtm
  ```

### Using issue template if issue forms are unavailable

For private repositories where [GitHub issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) are not available yet, [GitHub issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository) are an alternative that can be parsed by [zentered/issue-forms-body-parser](https://github.com/zentered/issue-forms-body-parser).
